# Writing Tests in Go

These are the slides from a talk I gave at "Newbie Night" at the Boston Go
meetup.

The slides use the `gopresent` tool to include code samples, so to view the
presentation, clone this repo and run `./launch.sh` to start the local
presentation server, then visit <http://localhost:3999>.

When I originally gave this talk, talks.godoc.org could be used to view the
slides, but unfortunately the site has since been decommissioned.
